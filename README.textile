p. Issues, features, etc (tickets in general) are not managed by the GitHub Issue tracking built-in feature,
for a more fine control and a diferent workflow they're all located at Lighthouse: "http://brushingbits.lighthouseapp.com/projects/54712-jnap/":http://brushingbits.lighthouseapp.com/projects/54712-jnap/
